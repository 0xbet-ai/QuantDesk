## Purpose

QuantDesk is an AI-agent workspace for quantitative trading.
Users research, backtest, and validate strategies through async interaction with AI agents (Analyst, Risk Manager).

- **Strategy Desk**: Workspace with budget (USD), target return, and stop-loss constraints. Pick from a curated catalog or generate a custom strategy from natural language.
- **Experiments & Runs**: Organize work into experiments (research threads) within a desk. Each experiment tracks multiple backtest runs with normalized results for comparison.
- **Dataset Management**: Reusable market data scoped per desk — exchange, pairs, timeframe, and date range. Shared across runs.
- **Code Versioning**: Per-desk git workspace. Agent commits strategy code on every change; each run links to its exact commit hash.
- **Paper Trading**: User approves a validated strategy to start paper trading. Engine runs the strategy in paper mode.
- **Engine Adapters**: Pluggable engines for backtesting and paper trading. See `doc/engine/README.md`.
- **Agent Layer**: AI CLI subprocess with session persistence and hipocampus-inspired memory compaction.

## Dev Setup

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, pnpm 9.15+, Docker (for engine executors only), Claude CLI (`claude`) or Codex CLI (`codex`).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

PostgreSQL runs in-process via `embedded-postgres` (data under `~/.quantdesk/pgdata`) — no Docker required for the database. Docker is reserved for engine executor containers (Freqtrade, Nautilus) spawned at runtime.

To point at an external Postgres instead, set `DATABASE_URL` before running any script (`dev`, `db:migrate`, `db:seed`, `db:reset`).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm dev` | Start server + UI in dev mode |
| `pnpm build` | Build all packages |
| `pnpm typecheck` | TypeScript type checking |
| `pnpm check` | Biome linter + formatter |
| `pnpm test` | Vitest test suite |
| `pnpm db:migrate` | Run Drizzle migrations |
| `pnpm db:generate` | Generate migration from schema changes |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default |
|----------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://quantdesk:quantdesk@localhost:5432/quantdesk` |
| `PORT` | `3000` |
| `AGENT_MODEL` | `claude-opus-4-6` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` |

## Rules

1. **English only** — all code, comments, strings, docs, commits.
2. **File refs** — repo-root relative (`src/core/runner.ts:42`), never absolute.
3. **Commits** — `<type>: <description>`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`.
4. **Secrets** — never commit. Use env vars. `.env` is gitignored.
5. **Scope** — backtesting and paper trading only. **Live trading is an explicit forever non-goal** — never implement, design for, or expose real-money trading in APIs or UI. No API keys for trading, no custody, no order routing to real venues.
6. **Engine is internal** — never expose engine name (freqtrade, nautilus) to the user in UI. Users pick a **strategy mode** (`classic` or `realtime`); the system maps that to an engine behind the scenes.
7. **Supported engines: Freqtrade and Nautilus Trader only.** Hummingbot is explicitly out of scope. Generic engine remains as a fallback for venues with no managed engine. Like managed engines, the generic engine runs inside a pinned Docker image (Ubuntu base + Python) — never on the host. Generic supports both backtest and paper trading: the agent writes the strategy script, the fetch script, and the paper loop script, all executed inside the generic container.
8. **Strategy mode → engine mapping:**
   - `classic` → **Freqtrade** — candle-based polling strategies, TA indicators, minute-to-hour timeframes. Default/recommended. Freqtrade's `dry_run` mode shares the same code path as live, giving the highest paper fidelity.
   - `realtime` → **Nautilus** — event-driven strategies reacting to ticks and order book deltas, sub-second timeframes, market making, arbitrage, HFT. Uses `SandboxExecutionClient` for paper.
   - The onboarding wizard asks the user to pick a mode **between venue selection and strategy selection**. When a venue supports both engines, the mode choice decides which engine is used. When a venue only supports one mode, the other mode is disabled for that venue.
9. **Paper trading uses engine-native paper modes for managed engines** — never build a custom paper trading simulator for Freqtrade or Nautilus. Managed desks always use Freqtrade `dry_run: true` or Nautilus `SandboxExecutionClient`. Generic desks run agent-authored paper loop scripts inside the generic container, because there is no "native" engine to defer to — the agent's script is the engine.
10. **One mode per desk** — each desk pins a single `strategy_mode` (and therefore a single engine) at creation time. Both are **immutable** for the desk's lifetime, enforced at the app level in `services/desks.ts`. All runs (backtest + paper) within the desk use the pinned engine. This guarantees backtest↔paper fidelity consistency and prevents cross-engine comparison confusion.
11. **Engines run in Docker** — all engine processes (managed backtest, managed paper, and generic backtest) execute inside Docker containers using images with **pinned version tags** (never `:latest`). Managed engines use official Freqtrade/Nautilus images; the generic engine uses a pinned Ubuntu + Python base image with workspace-mounted user scripts. Never install any engine natively on the host. Rationale: isolation of LLM-generated strategy code, reproducibility, simplified user setup. The server, UI, and Claude/Codex CLI run on the host — only the engine layer is containerized.
12. **Paper session recovery** — paper runs may live for days. Containers are tagged with labels (`quantdesk.runId`, `quantdesk.engine`, `quantdesk.kind=paper`) so the server reconciles running containers on restart via `docker ps` rather than marking them as failed. The in-memory registry is rebuilt from Docker as the source of truth.
13. **First-run data fetch is agent-proposed, user-approved.** For any brand-new desk with no strategy code and no registered dataset, the agent's FIRST response must be a `[PROPOSE_DATA_FETCH] {...} [/PROPOSE_DATA_FETCH]` block containing `{exchange, pairs, timeframe, days, tradingMode, rationale}`. The agent must then stop and wait — it must not write code or emit `[RUN_BACKTEST]` until a user-approved fetch has completed. The UI renders this proposal as inline Approve/Reject buttons. On approve, the server runs the engine-specific download inside a container (classic → freqtrade `download-data`; realtime → Nautilus DataCatalog; generic → agent-authored fetch script executed in the generic Ubuntu container), registers a Dataset row, and posts a system comment that re-triggers the agent to continue with strategy authoring and `[RUN_BACKTEST]`. On reject, the agent is re-triggered so it can propose a revised dataset. The server does **not** silently auto-download — the agent owns the decision of venue/pair naming/timeframe/history window, and the user owns the approval.
14. **Docs are the spec, code follows.** `doc/` describes the intended system in the present tense as if it were fully implemented. Never write "TODO", "planned", "not yet implemented", "coming soon", "awaiting", or similar hedging language anywhere in `doc/`. If the code contradicts a doc, the default is to fix the code — not the doc — unless the user explicitly approves a spec change. When you discover an unimplemented spec item, surface it to the user; never weaken the spec document to match the code.

## Conventions

- **TypeScript** strict mode. `type` imports. No `any`.
- **Zod** for runtime validation. Schemas in `packages/shared/`.
- **Biome** for formatting/linting (not ESLint/Prettier). Run `pnpm check` before commit.
- **Drizzle ORM** with PostgreSQL. Migrations in `packages/db/drizzle/`.

## Doc Consistency

If code contradicts `doc/` files, flag it before proceeding. **Never modify `CLAUDE.md` or `doc/` without explicit user approval.**

## Verification

Run before claiming done:

```bash
pnpm typecheck && pnpm check && pnpm test && pnpm build
```
